go to app/stylesheet/application.css erase everything in there if ur starting a new rails app this file is usually called application.scss in the asset pipeline

@import url(materialize-css/dist/css/materialize); this is the only line that should be inside of app/javascript/stylesheets/application.css this file is a file we create if ur runing a new rails app 

check environment.js it should only have this in there

const { environment } = require('@rails/webpacker')

const webpack = require('webpack')
environment.plugins.prepend('Provide',
  new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
    $: 'jquery/src/jquery',
    jQuery: 'jquery/src/jquery'
    // popper: ['popper.js', 'default']
  })
)

module.exports = environment



run this in the terminal yarn install --check-files 

if u get an error check package.jason file
it should look like this 
{
  "name": "e_haggel",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "@rails/actioncable": "^6.0.0",
    "@rails/activestorage": "^6.0.0",
    "@rails/ujs": "^6.0.0",
    "@rails/webpacker": "4.2.2",
    "jquery": "^3.5.1",
    "materialize": "^1.0.0",
    "materialize-css": "^1.0.0",
    "popper.js": "^1.16.1",
    "turbolinks": "^5.2.0"
  },
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "devDependencies": {
    "webpack-dev-server": "^3.11.0"
  }
}
u can have bootstrap or another css framework instead of materialize (u just have to add it with yarn or see the documentation)
if u have wrong version of jquery remove it and update like the above
run rails db:migrate to migrate the database 


run rails s to start the server
